Booths-Algorithm
=====================

Booth's Algorithm finds the product of two signed numbers; the included programs are two variations of finding these two numbers using 16-bit assembly. These programs were created in Fall 2007 as part of the Computer Assembly and Architecture course at Maryville University.
